Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

> Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
> Output: [3,4,5]<br>
> Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:

> Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]<br>
> Output: [4,5,6]<br>
> Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
